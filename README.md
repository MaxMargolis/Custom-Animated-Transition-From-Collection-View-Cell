# Custom-Animated-Transition-From-Collection-View-Cell
I don't like it when modal view controllers fly out of nowhere.
This Swift project is an example of using UIViewControllerTransitioning delegate to make a custom animation that presents a view controller from out of the frame of a tapped collection view cell.
If you are using this as a reference, keep in mind that the particular animation I'm using is designed to look nice with the particular views in this example project, but may not look best for your use case.
